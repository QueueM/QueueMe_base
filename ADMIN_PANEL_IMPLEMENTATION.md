## Prerequisites

- Django 3.2+ project
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for compiling static assets if needed)
- Access to the project's static files directory
- Administrative access to the server

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Copy Template Files

Copy the custom admin template files to your project's template directory:

```bash
mkdir -p templates/admin
cp -r path/to/custom/templates/admin/* templates/admin/
```

Ensure the following templates are included:
- `templates/admin/base.html`
- `templates/admin/index.html`
- `templates/admin/app_index.html`
- `templates/admin/change_list.html`
- `templates/admin/change_form.html`
- `templates/admin/delete_confirmation.html`
- `templates/admin/login.html`
- `templates/admin/password_change_form.html`
- `templates/admin/password_change_done.html`

### 2. Copy Static Files

Copy the custom CSS and JavaScript files to your project's static directory:

```bash
mkdir -p static/css/admin
mkdir -p static/js/admin
cp path/to/custom/static/css/admin/custom_admin.css static/css/admin/
cp path/to/custom/static/js/admin/custom_admin.js static/js/admin/
```

### 3. Copy Utility Files

Copy the admin utility files to your project's utils directory:

```bash
mkdir -p utils
cp path/to/custom/utils/admin.py utils/
cp path/to/custom/utils/admin_site.py utils/
cp path/to/custom/utils/admin_models.py utils/
```

### 4. Update URLs Configuration

Update your project's main URLs file to use the custom admin site:

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from utils.admin_site import queueme_admin_site

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', queueme_admin_site.urls),
    # ... other URL patterns
]
```

### 5. Configure Templates in Settings

Ensure Django can find the template files by updating your settings.py:

```python
# settings.py
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
        ],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

### 6. Configure Static Files in Settings

Ensure Django can find the static files:

```python
# settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

### 7. Collect Static Files

Run the collectstatic command to gather all static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 8. Register Models with Custom Admin Classes

Update your app's admin.py files to use the custom admin classes:

```python
# yourapp/admin.py
from utils.admin import ShopAdmin, CustomerAdmin
from .models import Shop, Customer

# Register models with custom admin classes
# This step is not necessary if you're using the utils/admin_models.py approach
```

### 9. Restart Application Server

Restart your application server to apply the changes:

```bash
# For Gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

# For uWSGI
sudo systemctl restart uwsgi

# For Daphne (if using Channels)
sudo systemctl restart daphne
```

### 10. Clear Browser Cache

Have users clear their browser cache when accessing the admin site for the first time to ensure all new assets are loaded properly.

## Troubleshooting

### Template Loading Issues

If the custom templates aren't being loaded:

1. Verify the template paths in your settings.py
2. Check that templates are in the correct directory structure
3. Ensure no app templates are overriding your custom templates (template precedence)

### Static File Loading Issues

If CSS or JavaScript files aren't loading:

1. Verify the static file paths in your settings.py
2. Check that collectstatic was run successfully
3. Inspect browser network tab for 404 errors on static files
4. Verify your web server is configured to serve static files

### Admin Site Registration Issues

If models aren't displaying properly:

1. Check that all models are properly registered with the custom admin site
2. Verify the custom admin site is properly configured in URLs
3. Ensure no conflicting admin registrations exist in app admin.py files

## Performance Considerations

The custom admin panel includes advanced UI features that may impact performance on lower-end devices:

1. Enable compression for CSS and JavaScript files:
   ```python
   # settings.py
   MIDDLEWARE = [
       # ...
       'django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware',
       # ...
   ]
   ```

2. Consider using a CDN for Font Awesome and Google Fonts:
   ```html
   <!-- Already configured in templates -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">
   ```

3. Minify CSS and JavaScript files for production:
   ```bash
   # Using django-compressor or similar tools
   python manage.py compress
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. Ensure proper permissions are set for all admin views
2. Use HTTPS for all admin site access
3. Consider implementing additional security measures:
   - Two-factor authentication
   - IP address restrictions
   - Failed login attempt tracking

## Updating the Admin Panel

When updating the custom admin panel:

1. Back up existing templates and static files
2. Apply changes incrementally to minimize disruption
3. Test changes thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production
4. Consider creating a deployment script for admin updates

## Conclusion

Following these steps should successfully implement the custom QueueMe admin panel in your production environment. For additional assistance or customization, refer to the `ADMIN_PANEL_README.md` file or contact the development team.
